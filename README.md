# calculate-storage

Uses a GitHub Issue as a dashboard for the disk usage of multiple machines. Run `calculate_storage.py` on each machine: it reads the Markdown table in the target Issue body, measures the drives registered for the current host with [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil), and rewrites only those rows through the GitHub API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later (CI covers 3.10 to 3.13 and the latest 3.x on Ubuntu and Windows)
- Dependencies in `requirements.txt` (`psutil`, `requests`)
- A GitHub token that can read and edit the target Issue

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir -p data
# write the token into the file with an editor, then restrict it
chmod 600 data/github_token.txt
```

The token is read from `data/github_token.txt` relative to the current working directory (not from an environment variable). `data/` and `results/` are git-ignored; never commit them.

## Issue format

Each managed row is a Markdown table row followed by an HTML comment marker that identifies the host and the drive:

```
| ✅ | hostname1 | C: | 1.20 TB (75.0%) | 1.60 TB (SSD) | <!-- calculate-storage#hostname1#C -->
```

- Row marker: `<!-- calculate-storage#<computer_name>#<drive> -->`. `computer_name` must equal the host name reported by the machine (`COMPUTERNAME` on Windows, `os.uname()[1]` elsewhere). `drive` is passed as is to `psutil.disk_usage()`, so it can differ from the displayed drive column (for example marker `C` with display `C:`, or a mount point such as `/`).
- Table part: `| mark | computer | drive | used | size (type) |`. The size column must look like `1.60 TB (SSD)` (`[TGMK]B` unit followed by the drive type in parentheses).
- Rows without a marker are kept unchanged. A marker row whose table part does not split into 7 `|`-separated parts or whose size column does not match the format above is not parsed and is dropped when the body is rewritten, so keep the format exact.
- Add the rows yourself; the tool never creates new ones. After an update the mark is 🔴 when usage is above 90%, otherwise ✅.

## Usage

```bash
python calculate_storage.py <ISSUE_NUMBER>
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | `book000/book000` | `owner/repo` that holds the Issue |
| `CALCULATE_STORAGE_LOG_DIR` | Unix: `/opt/calculate-storage/logs`, Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\calculate-storage\logs` | Log directory (created if missing) |

The log directory must be writable: with the default on Unix you need write access to `/opt/calculate-storage/logs`, so set `CALCULATE_STORAGE_LOG_DIR` when running as a normal user.

### Output

- Issue: the matching rows of the Issue body are updated through `PATCH /repos/{repo}/issues/{number}`. The body is fetched again just before writing to reduce conflicts with other hosts.
- Log: `YYYY-MM-DD.log` in the log directory (DEBUG level; the console shows INFO and above).
- Results: `results/<hostname>_<YYYYMMDD>.txt` in the working directory, one JSON object per line (JSON Lines despite the `.txt` extension) with `drive`, `used`, `total`, `percent`, `used_size`, `total_size` and `update_result`.

If the host has no rows in the Issue, the tool logs a warning and exits without writing. A drive for which `psutil.disk_usage()` fails is logged and skipped.

## Deployment scripts

`calculate-storage.sh` (Linux/Unix, run as root) and `calculate-storage.ps1` (Windows PowerShell) clone or update this repository (`/opt/calculate-storage` or `%USERPROFILE%\calculate-storage`), create a virtual environment, install the requirements, and run the tool. Both read the Issue number from the `ISSUE_NUMBER` environment variable and expect `data/github_token.txt` inside that directory.

```bash
sudo ISSUE_NUMBER=123 bash calculate-storage.sh
```

```powershell
$env:ISSUE_NUMBER = "123"; .\calculate-storage.ps1
```

Warning: both scripts run `docker system prune -a -f` when `docker` is available, which removes all unused Docker images, stopped containers, unused networks and build cache on the host before collecting disk usage. The shell script also creates `/opt/calculate-storage` with mode 777 (so keep the token file readable by its owner only, e.g. `chmod 600 data/github_token.txt`), offers to install a missing `git` or `python3` through `apt`/`yum` after asking for confirmation, and installs `python3-venv` through `apt` without asking when `ensurepip` is unavailable.

## Development

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s . -p "test_*.py"
```

The tests mock GitHub and psutil and need no network or token. Python files use 2-space indentation (see `.editorconfig`). See `AGENTS.md` for contributor and agent guidance.
